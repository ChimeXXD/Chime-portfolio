          <span>Ask first</span>. I always ensure that we're asking the right
          questions and taking on the right challenges before diving into
          design. This phase also involves consulting, exploring potential
          solutions, and conducting market research and competitive analyses.

          <span>Problem solving</span>. You'll have a pixel-perfect design for
          your app or website at the conclusion of this phase. I develop
          prototypes that simulate the final results before development as I
          move from wireframes to the final design.
